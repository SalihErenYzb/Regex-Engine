This is my own Regex engine implementation that is not meant to be used in production. It is mostly for education purposes. I'm also trying to make it very efficient.

TODO: Try to find a way to do dfs without using unordered_set for efficiency
TODO: Make it possible to run with UTF-8 characters
TODO: Make it possible to init giving a map of special characters like (,|,*,+,) etc.
TODO: Make code cleaner and more readable
TODO: Add support for [a-z] and [0-9] etc.
TODO: Add support for ^ and $ for start and end of string
TODO: Add support for \d, \w, \s etc.
TODO: Add support for ?, :, or {} etc.
TODO: Add function to find all matches 
TODO: Make it possible to reach substrings inside () after matches.
TODO: Return the matching string which allows indexing for every () in the regex????
TODO: Turn the visualizer into a small application that show the graphs DFS over characters of a text.
