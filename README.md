# Regex-Engine
Regex Engine that treats all symbols as literals and plain text as operators

# Reason I started this project
One night before going to sleep, I was scrolling through Twitter and saw a tweet by Notch discussing how Regex could be implemented. Coincidentally, that same day, I had attended an algorithms class where my professor gave a lecture on the implementation of Regex, which I found very insightful. Without much thought, I replied to the tweet, not expecting much response. The next day, I woke up to the image below.

#TODO
* Learn every little detail about Regex and about how it works.
* Implement the Regex engine in C++.
* Optimize it to be as fast as standard regex engines.
* Turn it into package that can be used in different languages(have no idea how to do this)
* Maybe write a version that uses only stack memory.
